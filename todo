criteria to check on new revisions, make sure:

   : works in qutebrowser
   ; works in matlab (when it is bound to the same key as Ret matlab sees it as 'Ret ;'
   ctrl-shift-z works in inkscape as redo (sometimes inkscape does not see the shift and you get undo)
   'ctrl-/ Ret' starts a new terminal in xmonad

consider moving away from xmodmap because
it is sooo confusing, and becasue it does not work with
wayland.
also using a low level hack cam make it work
with X11, wayland, and the bare console all in one go
this might solve a bunch of my problems,
such as xmonad not recognizing qwerky numbers,
or x2goclient ignoring qwerkey.

here are two possible ways to do this:

https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/tools
has a space2 meta plugin already probably easy to modify
to space2control

http://welz.org.za/projects/mxk
has a good tutorial
works with joy sticks, trackpads, etc
so might be good for adaptive gaming


pretty good online keyboard editor (but save to .svg does does not make a good image file)
http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com
my layout is saved in the file keyboard-layout.json.
i edit this with "gvim keyboard-layout.json", and do select-all and copy.
note that github.com is not letting me login,
and if you go to the RawData, you can select-all and then paste your text in.
