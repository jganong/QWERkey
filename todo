criteria to check on new revisions, make sure:

   : works in qutebrowser
   ; works in matlab (when it is bound to the same key as Ret matlab sees it as 'Ret ;'
   ctrl-shift-z works in inkscape as redo (sometimes inkscape does not see the shift and you get undo)
   'ctrl-/ Ret' starts a new terminal in xmonad

consider moving away from xmodmap because
it is sooo confusing, and becasue it does not work with
wayland.
also using a low level hack cam make it work
with X11, wayland, and the bare console all in one go
this might solve a bunch of my problems,
such as xmonad not recognizing qwerky numbers,
or x2goclient ignoring qwerkey.

here are two possible ways to do this:

https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/tools
has a space2 meta plugin already probably easy to modify
to space2control

http://welz.org.za/projects/mxk
has a good tutorial
works with joy sticks, trackpads, etc
so might be good for adaptive gaming


pretty good online keyboard editor
http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com
"Download SVG (Experimental)" does does not make a good file,
but "Download PNG (Experimental) works fine.
When you want to revise an existing .JSON layout,
in the RawData Tab you can "Upload JSON"
and that works quickly and reliably.  Other methods like
copy & paste sometimes do not seem to have any effect.
Click on the Properties Tab to get out of the RawData tab
and go back to editing individual keys.
